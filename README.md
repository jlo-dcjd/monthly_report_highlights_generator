This table-to-text app is a tool that helps users quickly and easily generate text summaries of their excel data. The app uses Streamlit to take in an excel report and output text about the data, including descriptions of month-to-month percent changes and year-to-date changes. The app uses logic-based algorithms to analyze the data and provide clear, concise descriptions of the trends and patterns within the data. This makes it easy for users to quickly understand and interpret their data, without the need for complex data analysis tools or expertise. The app is a useful tool to quickly and easily summarize the departmental excel data for reporting purposes.

This app is designed to be flexible and adaptable to changing data. This means that the app can respond to tables that change dynamically whenever sections in the reports are added or removed based on monthly data.

To try out the app, upload the `departmental_report_example.xlsx` from this repository to the web app and it will generate a highlights report. Please note that the excel file contains fictitious data which is used for demonstration purposes only.
